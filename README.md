### Nextcloud account

if you want to use an external calendar, you have to enter the correct server address.  
at nextcloud as follows:

    - server: "https://xxxxx/remote.php/dav",
    - username: "xxxxm",
    - password: "xxxxx",

## Features

- Local Calendar
- Nextcloud calendar
- Google Calendar
- subscribe to calendar
- moon phases

I tested subscribing to calendar with google calendar. you have the possibility to subscribe to public calendars and private calendars, in the google calendar settings you will find an ID that you can enter in greg (by hand or qr code).

## How to install

The app is not available through the https://www.kaiostech.com/store/ They are only accepting apps that are monetized using <a href="https://developer.kaiostech.com/submit-to-kaistore">KaiAds SDK</a>, and that's something I'm not interested in integrating.
For this reason, you have to side-load (upload) the app to your phone if you want to use it.
Martin Kaptein wrote a comprehensive, <a href="https://www.martinkaptein.com/blog/sideloading-and-deploying-apps-to-kai-os/">step-by-step article</a> that you can use to side-load the app. If you prefer a video, this one on YouTube walks you through the process.
The Developer Portal also contains a guide, and if nothing seems to work, you can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rQ93zEu">ask for help on Discord</a>.
You can download the latest version from the Releases page.
The app is not auto-updating. To update it, you have to follow the same steps you took when installing it.
